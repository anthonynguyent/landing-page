# landing-page

This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The primary objective was to recreate a reference website from scratch, with a strong emphasis on achieving a well-structured layout and ensuring responsiveness across various devices. While there may be some resizing issues, the desktop version closely resembles the layout of the reference website. The website showcases a thoughtfully designed landing page, featuring key sections such as a header, hero section, information section, testimonial section, signup section, and footer. Through this project, I aimed to showcase my ability to create visually appealing and functional web pages using fundamental web technologies.

- CSS3
- Flexbox
