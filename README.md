## Usage

The landing page consists of the following sections:

- **Header section**: Contains navigation or branding elements. Include a logo and menu links using HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`. CSS can be applied to style the elements, set background colors, adjust font styles, and create responsive navigation.

- **Hero section**: Introduces the project or brand. HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<h1>`, and `<img>` can be used to structure the section. CSS can be applied to style the elements, such as setting background images, adjusting font sizes, and adding padding or margins.

- **Information section**: Provides more details about the product or service. Utilize HTML elements like `<p>`, `<h2>`, and `<img>` to create the desired content structure. CSS can be applied to format the text, position the images, and control the spacing.

- **Testimonial section**: Displays quotes or feedback from satisfied customers or users. Include testimonials using HTML elements like `<div>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<cite>`. CSS can be applied to style the blockquote, adjust the font styles, and add decorative elements.

- **Signup section**: Allows visitors to sign up for updates or newsletters. HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` can be used to create the signup form. CSS can be applied to style the form elements, apply appropriate spacing, and create a visually appealing design.

- **Footer section**: Includes additional links, legal information, or contact details. Utilize HTML elements such as `<footer>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` to structure the footer. CSS can be applied to style the elements, set background colors, adjust font styles, and create a visually appealing design.
